TBD

### Christos Verginis (Assistant Professor, Uppsala Uni., Sweden) - "TBD"

Christos Verginis is an assistant Department of Electrical Engineering, Uppsala University, Sweden. He received the MEng degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering and the MSc degree in Automatic Control Systems and Robotics both from National Technical University of Athens (NTUA) in 2013 and 2015, respectively. He received the PhD in Electrical Engineering from KTH Royal Institute of Technology (Stockholm) under the guidance of Prof. Dimos Dimarogonas and Prof. Danica Kragic. His PhD Thesis involved planning and control of multi-robot manipulator-endowed systems. His PhD thesis was awarded the EECI PhD award on Control for Complex and Heterogeneous Systems 2021 and was selected to be one of the finalists for the EuRobotics Georges Giralt PhD award 2021.

### Sofie Haesaert (Assistant Professor, TU Eindhoven, Netherlands) - ""

Sofie Haesaert holds a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering and a master's degree in Systems and Control from Delft University of Technology, both cum laude. As a master's degree student, Haesaert spent a summer doing research at the University of Texas Arlington (USA). Haesaert obtained her PhD from Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e) in 2017 and then went to Caltech (USA) for 17 months to do a postdoc. In 2018, Haesaert returned to TU/e to become Assistant Professor in the Control Systems group.

### Yulong Gao (Assistant Professor, Imperial College London, UK) - ""

Yulong Gao received the B.E. degree in automation and the M.E. degree in control science and engineering from the Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China, in 2013 and 2016, respectively, and the joint Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden, and Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, in 2021. He was a Visiting Student with the Department of Computer Science, University of Oxford, Oxford, U.K., in 2019. He is currently a Postdoctoral Researcher with KTH. His research interests include automatic verification, stochastic control, and model predictive control with application to safety-critical systems.

### Meng Guo (Assistant Professor, Peking University, China) - ""

Meng Guo received his M.Sc. degree (2011) in System, Control, and Robotics and the Ph.D. degree (2016) in Electrical Engineering from KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden. He was a postdoctoral associate with the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science, Duke University, USA. During 2018-2021, he worked as a senior research scientist on Reinforcement Learning and Planning at the Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence (BCAI), Germany. Since 2022, he is an assistant professor at the Department of Mechanics and Engineering Science, College of Engineering, Peking University, China. He was the finalist of the EuRobotics George Giralt PhD Award 2017 and the European Embedded Control Institute (EECI) PhD Award 2017.
